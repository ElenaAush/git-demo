Got chrome in ma' bloodstream
Got a hardwired metal soul
I'm craving serious action
That smack, drag drunken roll
Chips are bashin' in ma' top
Ridin' high ma' slots are shot
Metal burnin' 'neath ma' skin
 
I'm Chippin'In
Chippin' In
 
Chips are buzzin', Implants hot
Ridin' high ma' slots are shot
Metal burnin''neath ma'skin
I'm Chippin' In!
 
Chippin' In - got my back to the wall
Chippin' In - c'mon hear ma' call
Chippin' In - I'm the man of steel
Chippin' In - Fuckin' Feel it
I'm Real!
 
Justice called heavy violence
Gonna boost and hit the street
Corp plague in violent droves
Made of greed, they packn' heat
 
Cold chrome, spent molten lead
Can't be killed cause I'm really dead
Stand, don't feed the ghost within
 
I'm Chippin' In
Chippin' In
 
Chips are buzzin', Implants hot
Ridin' high ma' slots are shot
Metal burnin''neath ma'skin
I'm Chippin' In!
 
Chippin' In - got yo back to the wall
Chippin' In - c'mon scream out that call
Chippin' In - you're built of steel
Chippin' In - Fuckin' Feel it
You're Real!
 
Chippin' In - got my back to the wall
Chippin' In - c'mon hear ma' call
Chippin' In - I'm the man of steel
Chippin' In - Fuckin' Feel it
I'm Real!
